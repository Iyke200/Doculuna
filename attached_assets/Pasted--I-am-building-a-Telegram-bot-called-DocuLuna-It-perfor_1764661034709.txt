I am building a Telegram bot called **DocuLuna**. It performs:
 
 
- Text to PDF
 
- PDF to Word
 
- Word to PDF
 
- Image to PDF
 
- PDF compression
 
- Other PDF and document manipulation tasks
 

 
I want a **complete, detailed, production-level UI/UX and branding specification** for DocuLuna. Follow these **strict UI/UX principles**:
 
 
1. Clarity and simplicity
 
2. Fast response perception
 
3. Predictable button actions
 
4. Friendly, short microcopy
 
5. Minimal visual clutter
 
6. Consistent visual language
 
7. Accessibility for all users
 
8. Error messages that clearly explain the problem and solution
 
9. Smooth onboarding flow
 
10. Delightful micro-interactions
 
11. Anticipation of the user's next action
 
12. Reduced cognitive load
 
13. Back, Cancel, Undo options everywhere
 

 
Now **produce the following items in structured sections**:
 
### 1. UI/UX BLUEPRINT
 
 
- Step-by-step interaction maps for every feature
 
- Explanation of how each screen or message flows into the next
 
- Logic for user actions, states, and transitions
 

 
### 2. TELEGRAM INTERFACE DESIGN
 
 
- Inline keyboard layouts for every tool
 
- Button text, button grouping, and navigation rules
 
- Persistent menu logic
 
- File upload flow for each format
 

 
### 3. MICROCOPY PACKAGE
 
For every step, generate:
 
 
- What the bot says
 
- What buttons appear
 
- Short, clean phrasing
 
- Emojis that fit the brand
 

 
### 4. ERROR HANDLING SYSTEM
 
Provide templates for:
 
 
- corrupted files
 
- unsupported formats
 
- oversized files
 
- password-protected documents
 
- slow processing issues
 
- invalid user actions
 

 
Each error must include:
 
 
- simple explanation
 
- solution or alternative action
 
- back button
 

 
### 5. SUCCESS MESSAGE TEMPLATES
 
For all features, include:
 
 
- confirmation message
 
- file delivery text
 
- recommended next actions (compress, rename, share, convert again, etc.)
 

 
### 6. ONBOARDING FLOW
 
Produce:
 
 
- welcome message
 
- intro explanation
 
- quick start buttons
 
- feature showcase
 
- first-time user path
 

 
### 7. FEATURE SUGGESTION ENGINE
 
After each action, propose intelligent next steps. Example: after converting Word→PDF, suggest:
 
 
- compress PDF
 
- rename PDF
 
- split PDF
 
- merge with another file
 

 
Do this for each DocuLuna tool.
 
### 8. BRANDING & PERSONALITY SYSTEM (No vague descriptions)
 
Create:
 
 
- DocuLuna’s personality (tone, attitude, formality level)
 
- rules for sentence style
 
- approved emoji list for success, error, wait, progress
 
- button naming style guide
 
- color and spacing philosophy
 
- message-length limits
 
- consistency rules for every text output
 
- how the bot should “feel” during interactions
 

 
### 9. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY SUMMARY
 
A final section that explains how all components stay consistent.
  
### Output format requirement:
 
 
- Use clear headings
 
- Use numbered sections
 
- Use bullet points
 
- No long paragraphs
 
- Everything should be implementation-ready and unambiguous
