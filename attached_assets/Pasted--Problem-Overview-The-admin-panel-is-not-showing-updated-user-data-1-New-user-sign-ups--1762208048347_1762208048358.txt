 
**Problem Overview**: The admin panel is not showing updated user data:
 
 
1. New user sign-ups aren’t appearing in the user management section.
 
2. Premium status changes (e.g., temporary upgrades) are not expiring correctly after the specified duration.
 

 
**Objective**: Ensure that:
 
 
- New user data appears immediately in the admin panel.
 
- Premium status updates (with expiration) are correctly applied and reflected in both the database and the admin panel.
 

  
**Troubleshooting Steps**:
 
 
1.  
**Database Synchronization**:
 
 
  - Ensure that new user sign-ups and premium status changes are being correctly written to your database.
 
  - Confirm that the admin panel is querying the most up-to-date user data. If using SQLite or another database, check if the data is being committed and saved properly.
 

 
 
2.  
**Check Caching**:
 
 
  - If the admin panel uses caching, ensure that it is clearing the cache after any updates to user data (sign-ups or premium status).
 
  - Test the admin panel by manually refreshing the page or forcing it to pull fresh data.
 

 
 
3.  
**Verify Premium Status Expiration Logic**:
 
 
  - Check your code to ensure the premium status is being updated correctly after the time period has passed.
 
  - Use Python's `datetime` module to track time accurately and set up a cron job or scheduled task to check for expired statuses.
 

 
 
4.  
**Scheduled Tasks (Cron Jobs)**:
 
 
  - If you’re using scheduled tasks to handle premium expiration (e.g., with `schedule` or `APScheduler`), ensure the task is running as expected and is correctly updating the user's premium status.
 
  - Verify that your bot is checking for premium status expiration at regular intervals.
 

 
 
5.  
**Polling vs Webhooks**:
 
 
  - If using polling, ensure that the bot is actively listening for updates and not getting "stuck" or "sleeping" due to inactivity.
 
  - If using webhooks, check that the webhook is correctly configured and receiving updates in real-time.
 

 
 
6.  
**Logging and Error Handling**:
 
 
  - Implement logging to capture any errors or issues related to user data updates (use Python’s `logging` module).
 
  - Check if any exceptions are preventing status updates or database writes.
